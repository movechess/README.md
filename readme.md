What is the project’s purpose
Enter MoveChess, MoveLabs flagship project, designed to pioneer a new era in blockchain gaming. By seamlessly integrating the growing market of online chess, with optimized smart contract design; MoveChess is poised to revolutionize online Monetized Chess Matches (MCM’s). We are committed to not only harnessing the potential of blockchain but also making it accessible and user-friendly. With MoveChess, we aim to provide a secure, transparent, and enjoyable experience that truly revolutionizes online gaming while simultaneously building trust in the blockchain industry.

What problem does it solve?
We are developing the MoveChess product to provide products for the ecosystem and community. The most important thing is the community about creating a playground for users and the ecosystem. We want to create a Chess-loving community for degens users (almost all DeFi user activities are very limited in terms of physicality). About the product, we will create a physical project about the mind for users. At the same time, everything in the product will operate on-chain and contribute transaction hashes to the operation of the Aleph Zero blockchain by using the native token (AZERO) to develop the product.
